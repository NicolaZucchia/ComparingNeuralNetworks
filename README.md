# ComparingNeuralNetworks
This work regards comparison between different neural networks architectures in computer vision

Some notes about the work:
- Credits have been given to the author of the initial discussion on Kaggle for the work about nueral networks applied to Chest X Ray images
- Credits have been given to professor Dennis Shasha and Manda Wilson for the MeanConf.py script, which was used at the bottom of the Jupyter Notebook

Procedure:
1) Importing modules
2) Importing files 
3) Showing images 
4) Initializing Convolutional Neural Networks
5) Fitting, Optimizing, Evaluating CNNs
6) Predicitng classes for test set
7) Calculating accuracy, precision, recall, f-score for each architecture used
8) Calculating p-value for the paired differences 
9) Plotting results for the paired differences 
10) Plotting confidence intervals

Please note this is just a general flow of my work, full explanation can be found in the book Stateasy...
