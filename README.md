# ComparingNeuralNetworks
This work regards comparison between different neural networks architectures in computer vision

Some notes about the work:
- Credits have been given to the author of the initial discussion on Kaggle for the work about nueral networks applied to Chest X Ray images
- Credits have been given to professor Dennis Shasha and Manda Wilson for the MeanConf.py script, which was used at the bottom of the Jupyter Notebook
- We used 0.5 as critical probability in model predictions to determine which class the image belongs to (0 for NORMAL and 1 for PNEUMONIA)
- We used also 0.7 as critical probability for the first model used as the author on Kaggle does the same
- The choice of 0.5 as critical probability was confirmed by empirical calculation of the percentage of correct results and comparing that with the evaluations made
